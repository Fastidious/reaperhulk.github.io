**7/20/2010 Update** - Google has released a significant images update that breaks lightboxer. I'll look into this and fix it within the next week or so.

Google Lightboxer[^1] is a Safari 5 extension that creates a Lightbox[^2] slideshow on Google Images. Click any image and a slideshow will appear loading the full resolution images. If you don't want to have the lightbox appear, hold command and it will be disabled temporarily.

To install:




  * [Download](http://langui.sh/extensions/Google-Lightboxer.safariextz) the signed extension and double click to install[^3]

  * Load [Google Images](http://images.google.com) and do a search.



**Latest Release - v1.3**




  * Pulls the Google Images metadata into the colorbox so you can see it while you're browsing more easily.



Known issues:


  * Some JS errors in console. Will be resolved in future release, but they are cosmetic only.
