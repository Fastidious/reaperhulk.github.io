A few random shortcuts I use on a daily basis...[^1]



  * You can specify a unix path with the go to folder command in Finder?  ⌘-⇧-G


  * Using ⌘-1 through 9 in Safari will take you to your Bookmarks Bar bookmarks.  Folders will be ignored in the numbering


  * If you're in a file selection dialog you can use ⌘-D to go to Desktop.  Similarly ⌘-⇧-A works for Applications, ⌘-⇧-C for computer view, ⌘-⇧-H for home, and ⌘-⇧-I for idisk (automounts)


  * If you have a save/don't save dialog up you can select don't save with ⌘-D


  * ⌘-click on a window's title bar (in Finder, Safari, and other apps) to see a hierarchical menu


  * Drag/drop the icon in the title bar of document windows in nearly any application to perform drag/drop operations.  For example, you can drag a Word/Excel doc to Mail.app or Entourage to immediately open a new email with that doc attached.


  * Hold ⌥ and drag a file in the Finder to copy it to a new location.


  * Hold ⌥-⌘ and drag a file in the Finder to create an alias at the new location.


  * In cocoa applications you can use emacs shortcuts.


  * When browsing lists in the Finder type the first few letters of the file you're going to and it will immediately scroll to the first occurrence of the characters alphabetically.


[^1]: For the shortcuts ⌘ means command (also known as the apple key), ⇧ means shift, and ⌥ means option
