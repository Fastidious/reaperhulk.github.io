I got a bit bored with the name and domain of this blog, so I bought a domain hack.  Welcome to langui.sh...which will almost certainly live up to its name.  Existing links via swearingscience.com and paulkehrer.com will continue to work, although I may set up mod\_rewrites soon.  I'm not sure what that will do to the RSS/Atom feeds so it would be wise to update them if you're consuming the site in that fashion.

And yes, I do plan on updating CDN Tools for WP 2.8 compatibility soon!
