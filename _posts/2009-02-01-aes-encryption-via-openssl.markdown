If you have ever wanted to encrypt a blob of data for transmission or archival, OpenSSL provides a simple way to accomplish this task without resorting to platform specific tools.
To encrypt[^1]:

```bash
openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -in filename -out filename.enc
```

To decrypt:

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in filename.enc -out filename.dec
```

The example above uses AES256 in cipher block chaining mode (the CBC IV is auto-generated by OpenSSL), however there are almost 50 different cipher functions available for encryption.  To see a list, just type openssl enc help.  I would very seriously recommend staying with well-known and accepted standard ciphers like AES unless you have an explicit need to choose something more esoteric.

[^1]: You can also add -a to encode to base64 so you can easily send via email or other methods that don't support binary encoding.
