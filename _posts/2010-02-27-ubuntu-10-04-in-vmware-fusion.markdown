I installed the 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) 64-bit alpha 3 this morning to check out some of the new features.  And since I've done [a](/2009/10/29/upgrading-ubuntu-server-to-9-10/) [few](/2009/10/05/ubuntu-9-10-in-vmware/) [other](/2009/04/26/upgrading-ubuntu-server-810-intrepid-to-904-jaunty/) [articles](/2009/04/04/ubuntu-904-beta-in-vmware-fusion/) about running Ubuntu in a VM I thought I'd share the experience yet again.

If you're running VMWare Fusion 3.0+ (or the current release of Workstation 7) then the version of VMWare Tools you have with your software can successfully install with no manual intervention.  Simply pick easy install and let VMWare do all the work.

If you're running an older version you will want to take a look at my Ubuntu 9.10 [instructions](/2009/10/05/ubuntu-9-10-in-vmware/) for help with getting open-vm-tools running for you in 10.04.

I'll update this article if anything changes (the kernel freeze for Lucid Lynx is not until March 11).
