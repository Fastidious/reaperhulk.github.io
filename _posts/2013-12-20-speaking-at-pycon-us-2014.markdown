title: Speaking at Pycon US 2014
---

I'm pleased to say I will be speaking (along with Jarret Raim) at [Pycon](https://us.pycon.org/2014/) this upcoming April in Montreal. Our talk is titled [The State of Crypto in Python](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/202/) and covers the current and future landscape of cryptographic libraries available in Python. We'll be spending quite a bit of time talking about [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography), the project we hope to see become the standard interface for doing cryptographic operations in Python in the future. Hope to see you there!
