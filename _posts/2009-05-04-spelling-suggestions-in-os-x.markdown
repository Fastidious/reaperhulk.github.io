[![suggestions](/assets/media/2009/05/suggestions.png)](/assets/media/2009/05/suggestions.png)One of the lesser known OS X niceties is the ability to get spelling suggestions/completions from any standard Cocoa text input.  To accomplish this, simply hit the Escape key[^1]) in any supported application (iChat, Mail, and TextEdit are some examples) and be amazed.  I find this feature very useful for quickly obtaining the correct spelling of a word without taking your hands off the keyboard to get a correction.  Sadly, many applications use their own text handling for various reasons so this won't work universally (Word, TextMate, et cetera).

[^1]: In some cases Escape already has a bound behavior.  For these situations pressing Option-Escape may give the expected dropdown.  For example, in Adium the Escape key will clear your entry, but if you hit Option-Escape you will get the completion dropdown.
