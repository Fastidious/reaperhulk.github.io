### The Bad News


On Tuesday June 14 I received a cease and desist from MLB regarding Batter's Box. I've talked with them for the past week and I'm sad to report that Batter's Box has now been removed from the app store as of 3:30pm EDT June 20.

I'd like to thank Brian Kim, who provided invaluable assistance with art and image assets for the app, and the nearly 16000 of you who downloaded the app in the 2.5 months it was available.



### Stats (Downloads and Upgrades)

I am considering opening up the codebase since it may be useful/interesting to various developers, but I'll do another post if I decide to move forward with that.
