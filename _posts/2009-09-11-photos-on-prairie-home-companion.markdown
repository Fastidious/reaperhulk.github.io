[![prairie_home](/assets/media/2009/09/prairie_home-150x150.png)](/assets/media/2009/09/prairie_home.png)I have been informed that one of my photos was featured on the [Prairie Home Companion](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/) website and mailing list today.  Pretty cool!  It's an HDR I took in Pullman, WA with my XTi a few years ago.  If you're interested, take a look at the [original](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulkehrer/566051551/in/set-72157603537366583/) and poke around at some of my more [recent photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulkehrer/).  I've also got a set of [my favorites](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulkehrer/sets/72157603537366583/).

Update: A [permanent link](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2009/09/12/) to the Prairie Home episode.
