title: Python Cryptography
---

I, along with all the developers of [cryptography](https://cryptography.io), am pleased to announce the 0.2 release of our python cryptography library.

Cryptography is an attempt to build a comprehensive cryptography library for python that encompasses both low level (hazmat) APIs as well as high level recipes with safe defaults for general use. It is designed to be backend agnostic so you can use the same python API with various underlying C libraries.  As of v0.2 we have two backends available for use: OpenSSL and CommonCrypto (OS X 10.8+) with more to come.

Check out the [documentation](https://cryptography.io) for more information, [fork/clone on GitHub](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography), or join us in #cryptography-dev on Freenode to talk about the project.
