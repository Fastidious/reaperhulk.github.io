As promised, Fidgetr 1.0 has been released.  Here are the improvements since the last time I posted about it:




  * Incremented version to 1.0 to catch users stuck at versions earlier than 0.6.1.  Welcome back to the cutting edge!


  * Reworked the crossfade theme JS to fix some bugs and dramatically simplify the code.


  * Photoset support! Display your latest photos or photos from a photoset.


  * Removed requirement for allow\_url\_fopen. Fidgetr now tries to use the cURL libraries first.


  * Added an AJAX check to warn the user if their Flickr username/email is invalid.


  * Added some advanced CSS in the default theme (visible in Safari 4 only)


  * Fixed a quote issue with fetching comments, thanks lupinehorror!


  * Preliminary i18n support


  * Better compatibility


  * Quite a few minor fixes not listed.
