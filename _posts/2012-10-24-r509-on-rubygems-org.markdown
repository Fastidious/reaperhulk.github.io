As of 0.8 I've grown comfortable enough with the state of r509 that I've pushed v0.8 to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/r509). You can now just gem install r509 in any (non-jruby) installation to check it out. Take a look at the [documentation](http://r509.org/doc/index.html) to see what you can do!
