For the past few weeks I have been working on a small coding project and today I am proud to announce its first public release!


[Fidgetr](/fidgetr/) is a WordPress widget that displays the latest photos from your Flickr photostream in an attractive manner.  It features support for its own themes along with very simple setup and good compatibility with various WordPress themes.  I will likely continue to announce releases here, but Fidgetr's [homepage](/fidgetr/) will always have the latest news.  The code is hosted via subversion on wordpress.org and is licensed under the GPL.  I welcome any improvements and/or theme contributions!

A big thanks goes out to the following people:
Matt Pennig for his invaluable assistance with various javascript and CSS questions.
Major Hayden for testing the widget and tolerating my constant chattering about WP plugin development.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions feel free to leave them here or on Fidgetr's homepage.
