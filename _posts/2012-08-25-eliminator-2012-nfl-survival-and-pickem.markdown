For the past 8 years I've run a free NFL survival game called [SAS Eliminator](http://saseliminator.com). This year, with the help of [Sean Schulte](http://vikinghammer.com) I've rewritten it from the ground up. The new system supports 8 different game types including eliminator and pickem forms, reverse, and against the spread. We've put quite a bit of our personal time into the project, so [check it out](http://saseliminator.com), bet, and have fun!

On a more technical note, Eliminator is my first ramaze project. It's been an interesting experience, but that's another blog post!
