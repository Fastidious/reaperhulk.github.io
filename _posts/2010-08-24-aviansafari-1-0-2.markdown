Just a quick note that [AvianSafari](/aviansafari) 1.0.2 has been released.  If you're on a previous version you should upgrade immediately since the API key was reset (I foolishly committed it to my local repo and forgot I was planning on pushing it to a public Github repository).  If you're seeing Twitter authentication requests in Safari then that's the manifestation of the issue.  Sorry about that!
