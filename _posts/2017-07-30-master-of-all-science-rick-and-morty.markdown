title: Master of All Science - Rick & Morty
---

We've been quiet on the [Frinkiac](https://frinkiac.com) and [Morbotron](https://morbotron.com) front for awhile, but today we're introducing the newest member of the CompuGlobalHyperMegaCap family: [Master of All Science](https://masterofallscience.com).

GIF and meme your way to happiness[^1] with all the tools you've come to expect from our sites, but now with Rick & Morty! We've got every episode aired to date conveniently indexed so even an idiot like Jerry can find what they're looking for. Learn important facts like [Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=pluto%20is%20a%20cold%20celestial%20dwarf), buy some [turbulent juice](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=turbulent%20juice) while watching [ball fondlers](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=ball%20fondlers), or just listen to it [feels good](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=feels%20good) while you purge! You'll be like a god, the [infinite Rick](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=infinite%20rick).

Of course, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this project is all about that [Szechuan sauce](https://masterofallscience.com/?q=szechuan%20sauce). We're driven by finding that McNugget sauce. If it takes nine years, we want it [Justin](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/891521911460470784)! Nine years of [Master of All Science](https://masterofallscience.com), Justin, just for that sauce!
