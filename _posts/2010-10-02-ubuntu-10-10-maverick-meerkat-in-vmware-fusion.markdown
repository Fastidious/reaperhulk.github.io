[![](/assets/media/2010/10/ubuntu10.10_installing-300x253.png)](/assets/media/2010/10/ubuntu10.10_installing.png)I decided to check out Ubuntu 10.10 RC today and I'm pleased to report that installation of the latest version in VMware Fusion (3.1.1) was trivial.  I grabbed the install CD, told it to use "easy install" and away it went.  Mouse ungrab, drag/drop file sharing, sound, et cetera were all available as soon as the GUI came up after the VMware tools install completed.  HGFS was available as well under /mnt/hgfs.  If you're running an older version of VMware you may need to upgrade or grab the latest tools[^1] to have such a smooth experience.

[^1]: My version is 8.4.3
