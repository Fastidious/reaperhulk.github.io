I recently replaced my Canon Rebel XTi with a 5D Mark II, so I thought I'd share a few shots I got with the new camera while on vacation in Hawaii.  The higher resolution and (much) lower noise has been the biggest advantage at this point, but it helps that I now have two L glass lenses (70-200 f/4L IS and 24-105 f/4L IS).  I'm still on the fence about whether I like the new auto ISO features as I find myself turning it off and controlling ISO manually quite frequently.

Clicking the image will take you to Flickr where you can see EXIF data and view other sizes.
