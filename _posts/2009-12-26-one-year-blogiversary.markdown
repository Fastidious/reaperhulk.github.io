Around a year ago I finally decided to start a blog.  Since then I've changed the domain, name, written over 60 posts about various things, and released two WordPress plugins.  I had no defined goals when I started...and I still don't!  So in the spirit of my random posting, here are some stats about traffic growth and download numbers for my plugins.  Let the navel gazing commence.



### Random Traffic Statistics



The site has grown from an average of under 100 visits a week to well over 1500 now.  Much of that growth has been driven by the release of [Fidgetr](/fidgetr) and [CDN Tools](/cdn-tools), my WordPress plugins (more on them later).  However, the single most popular post I've written so far was the fix for [GrowlMail in 10.6.2](/2009/11/09/fixing-growlmail-letterbox-for-mail-4-2/).  Google indexed it quickly and it became the #1 search result for people attempting to fix their Mail plugin incompatibilities.  Other popular articles include items about VMware and [OpenSSL UCC/SAN certificates](/2009/02/28/openssl-sanucc-certificate-generation/).



### Plugin Statistics


Fidgetr has seen almost [9000 downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fidgetr/stats/) since its initial release at the end of January.  In that time it has dramatically improved, but I still welcome feature suggestions and patches (and new themes!).  Would Picasa support be a useful addition?

CDN Tools has had over [2000 downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cdn-tools/stats/) since the end of February.  Due to how deeply it hooks into WP I had to make significant changes for WP 2.8 as well as utilize several new hooks for WP 2.9 support.  There is still quite a ways to go before I'm happy with this plugin, but I'm pleased that so many people are using it on their blogs.

With these two plugins I am currently the 605th ranked WP plugin dev (by downloads) according to [w-shadow](http://w-shadow.com/files/top-1000-plugin-authors.html).  Top 500 here I come!
