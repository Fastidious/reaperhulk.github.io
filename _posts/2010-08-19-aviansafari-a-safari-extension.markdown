**AvianSafari is discontinued**

![](/assets/media/2010/08/avian100.png)I'm extremely proud to announce [AvianSafari](http://langui.sh/aviansafari), a browser bar based Twitter client for Safari.  You should [check it out](http://langui.sh/aviansafari) right now and then come back and read about it.  I can wait.

Okay, now that you've got it installed we can move on.  AvianSafari supports the following:


  * Home Timeline

  * Mentions

  * Sent Direct Messages

  * Received Direct Messages

  * Tweet Pagination (Scroll Wheel or Arrow Buttons)

  * Unread Tracking

  * Search

  * Trends

  * Native Retweet

  * Reply

  * Tweeting

  * Delete Tweets

  * Sending Direct Messages

  * URL Shortening (TinyURL, TinyVH, bit.ly, j.mp, is.gd)

  * Authenticated URL shortening for bit.ly / j.mp

  * Variable Update Interval

  * Controllable Link Behavior (new tab, current tab, tab position, et cetera)

  * Conversation threads

  * Linking @mentions and URLs

  * Much, much more!



For communication with Twitter I created AvianLib, an OAuth/Twitter library written in Javascript. I'll be putting AvianLib up as a separate project on Github in the near future so others can consume it.  If you'd like to take a look at [AvianSafari's source code](http://github.com/reaperhulk/AvianSafari/) or [provide feedback](http://github.com/reaperhulk/AvianSafari/issues) head on over!
