When I purchased my 5D I told myself I'd try my hand at a video.  Well, one year later I've finally worked up the ambition to learn some video editing and publish something  This video represents the past year of owning this camera.  I learned a great deal in the process (mostly about how to shoot better source footage for the future), but I hope you all enjoy it.
