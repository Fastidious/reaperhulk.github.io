Another update to my iOS app [Batter's Box](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/batters-box/id510063319?mt=8)!


#### Changelog



* You can now pick up to 3 favorite teams

* Delayed/postponed games look nicer in the list now (fixes regression from 1.3)

* Balls/strikes/outs are now more up to date on the game details view

* Animation now properly restarts on iPhone

* Last play now visible on iPhone on game details to provide additional context

* Last play now fades in after first play (rather than showing an empty box)

* Switch hitters now show opposite the pitcher's throwing arm

* Fix case where weather animation would stop after leaving and re-entering the app on iPhone

* Fixed recap links on iPhone

* Replaced day/night backgrounds for iPad with PNGs to stop some banding issues (mostly visible during day/night transitions)

* Miscellaneous small UI fixes (mostly on iPhone)
