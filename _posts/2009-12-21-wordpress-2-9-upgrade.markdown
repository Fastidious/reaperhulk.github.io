WP 2.9 is [out](http://wordpress.org/development/2009/12/wordpress-2-9/).  The upgrade went quite smoothly here, but be sure you upgrade your plugins before running the core upgrade!  [Fidgetr](/fidgetr) and [CDN Tools](/cdn-tools) are both 2.9 compatible already, so if you have the latest versions you're set.
