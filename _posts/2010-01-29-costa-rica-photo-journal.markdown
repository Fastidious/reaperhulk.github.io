I have returned from my trip to Costa Rica!  Typically I don't write about my personal experiences on this blog, but I've decided to try a photo journal style entry this time.  Don't worry, your regular nerd posts will resume shortly.  As always, click the photo to go to the Flickr page.  From there you can view any photo in **much** larger sizes.  Be sure to [view the set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulkehrer/sets/72157623184013285/) in its entirety as well.
