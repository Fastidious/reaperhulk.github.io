title: Reliably Distributing Compiled Modules in Python
---

At PyCon 2016 I gave a talk about reliably distributing compiled modules in Python. PyCon always records these sessions and puts them on YouTube so if you're interested in the topic it's embedded below.

One correction: In the video I state that 64-bit compilers for Python 3.3/3.4 require obtaining the non-free Visual Studio 2010 release. You can also obtain them via the Windows SDK (as several people have told me on Twitter). In the past when I've attempted to do this it hasn't worked, but I'm quite willing to believe I made an error. Thanks for the correction!
