[![](/assets/media/2011/03/itunes_classdata-300x124.png)](/assets/media/2011/03/itunes_classdata.png)If you've installed XCode 3.2.6 or 4.0 recently after previously installing iTunes 10.2.1 you may have seen this message when trying to sync: "iTunes was unable to load data class information from Sync Services. Reconnect or try again later."

To fix this problem you'll need to reinstall iTunes. [Download iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) from Apple, run the pkg, restart, and it should be fixed. Irritating, but at least there's an easy resolution.
